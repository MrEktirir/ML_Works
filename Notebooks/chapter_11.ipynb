There is some debate about this, as which is preferable seems to depend on the task—you can experiment with this too to see which option works best on your dataset. To add the BN layers before the activation function, you must remove the activation functions from the hidden layers and add them as separate layers after the BN layers. Moreover, since a batch normalization layer includes one offset parameter per input, you can remove the bias term from the previous layer by passing use_bias=False when creating it. Lastly, you can usually drop the first BN layer to avoid sandwiching the first hidden layer between two BN layers. The updated code looks like this:\n"

You can then reinitialize your model and train it with that learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* But you can do better than a constant learning rate: if you start with a large learning rate and then reduce it once training stops making fast progress, you can reach a good solution faster than with the optimal constant learning rate. There are many different strategies to reduce the learning rate during training. It can also be beneficial to start with a low learning rate, increase it, then drop it again. These strategies are called learning schedules (I briefly introduced this concept in Chapter 4). These are the most commonly used learning schedules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Power scheduling\n",
    "    * Set the learning rate to a function of the iteration number t: η(t) = η / (1 + t/s) . The initial learning rate η , the power c (typically set to 1), and the steps s are hyperparameters. The learning rate drops at each step. After s steps, the learning rate is down to η / 2. After s more steps it is down to η / 3, then it goes down to η / 4, then η / 5, and so on. As you can see, this schedule first drops quickly, then more and more slowly. Of course, power scheduling requires tuning η and s (and possibly c).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exponential scheduling\n",
    "    * Set the learning rate to η(t) = η 0.1 . The learning rate will gradually drop by a factor of 10 every s steps. While power scheduling reduces the learning rate more and more slowly, exponential scheduling keeps slashing it by a factor of 10 every s steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Piecewise constant scheduling\n",
    "    * Use a constant learning rate for a number of epochs (e.g., η = 0.1 for 5 epochs), then a smaller learning rate for another number of epochs (e.g., η = 0.001 for 50 epochs), and so on. Although this solution can work very well, it requires fiddling around to figure out the right sequence of learning rates and how long to use each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance scheduling\n",
    "    * Measure the validation error every N steps (just like for early stopping), and reduce the learning rate by a factor of λ when the error stops dropping.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1cycle scheduling\n",
    "    * 1cycle was introduced in a 2018 paper by Leslie Smith.⁠ Contrary to the other approaches, it starts by increasing the initial learning rate η , growing linearly up to η halfway through training. Then it decreases the learning rate linearly down to η again during the second half of training, finishing the last few epochs by dropping the rate down by several orders of magnitude (still linearly). The maximum learning rate η is chosen using the same approach we used to find the optimal learning rate, and the initial learning rate η is usually 10 times lower. When using a momentum, we start with a high momentum first (e.g., 0.95), then drop it down to a lower momentum during the first half of training (e.g., down to 0.85, linearly), and then bring it back up to the maximum value (e.g., 0.95) during the second half of training, finishing the last few epochs with that maximum value. Smith did many experiments showing that this approach was often able to speed up training considerably and reach better performance. For example, on the popular CIFAR10 image dataset, this approach reached 91.9% validation accuracy in just 100 epochs, compared to 90.3% accuracy in 800 epochs through a standard approach (with the same neural network architecture). This feat was dubbed superconvergence."
